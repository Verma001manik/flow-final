# Introduction
This project was done using the Cadence programming language for the flow blockchain technology . This project was required for the metacrafter's course . The purpose of this project is to know how nfts are minted and collections and created  are deployed in cadence . We have used the flow's playground (https://play.flow.com). 

# Description

In this project we created collection's and created NFT's and deployed them using the cadence programming language.

We were required to do few steps to complete this project . 
*  Add a function called borrowAuthNFT just like we did in the "The Problem" lesson above.
* Find a way to make it publicly accessible to other people so they can read our NFT's metadata.
* Run a script to display the NFTs metadata for a certain id.


# Getting started 
To run the code provided , you need to use the flow blockhain's playground and copy paste the code in the same folder's given already . 
Make sure you deploy the NonFungibleToken in other accounts(0x02,0x03,0x04). 

In the contracts after pasting the code above you need to click on the deploy option . make sure the code has no error's .
Go to the transactions and copy paste the code given and fill all the information and click 'send'.
You can name your own Nfts , and execute them and get their meta data . 
You are done !!!.
